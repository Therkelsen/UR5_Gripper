## Problem
<div style="text-align: justify">A gripper for the Universal Robots UR5 robot is to be developed during this semester project. An idea could be to follow the block diagram below, but not required.</div>
<p align="center"> <img src="Assets/Diagram.png" alt="Diagram" title="Diagram" width="60%" height="60%"/> </p>
<div style="text-align: justify">It is expected that you at least develop:
•	A 3D model of a gripper that can be printed or otherwise constructed.
•	Electronics to control the gripper.
•	A URCaps plugin for the UR controller.
•	Software design of a C++ Program developed on a Raspberry PI, a PC, or possibly both.
•	A modern communication interface to the gripper (e.g. OPC UA). Ideas to an interface:
•	The no. of grips
•	Gripper force
•	Gripper distance
•	Etc.

The gripper must fulfil the following requirements:
•	Supply voltage: 24V (from external supply – you are not allowed to use the robot controller as power supply)
•	The maximum gripper power use: 600mA
•	It is not allowed to use the digital I/O from the UR robot. All I/O must be done through the Raspberry Pi microcontroller. Please remember that the power output from digital I/O is very limited.
